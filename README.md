# vue-masonry-starter-pack

This starter template helps you get started with Vue and the Vue Masonry node package built by Mikhail Kuznetcov.

Found here: https://github.com/shershen08/vue-masonry
 
The original masonry library: https://masonry.desandro.com/

I've created this template for others to get started with the vue-masonry component and the use of axios to fetch data.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification

npm run build --report


```
